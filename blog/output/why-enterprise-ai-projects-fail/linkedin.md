80% of enterprise AI projects never reach production.

The failures aren't random. They're predictable—and preventable.

After 20+ years building enterprise technology, here are the 5 patterns we see repeatedly:

**1. Pilot Purgatory**
The demo works. Leadership applauds. Then it sits in "pilot" for 18 months. The team optimized for the presentation, not production.

**2. Data Debt**
Brilliant on test data. Nonsense in production. Nobody planned for messy, incomplete, constantly changing real-world data.

**3. Integration Hell**
The AI works in isolation. But connecting it to SAP, Salesforce, and legacy systems? That's where projects die.

**4. Compliance Afterthought**
Project ready to deploy. Legal reviews it. "Where's the audit trail?" Project shelved.

**5. Shadow AI**
While IT debates strategy, departments deploy their own ChatGPT solutions. Uncontrolled risk everywhere.

The 20% that succeed share common traits:

→ Executive sponsor with budget authority (not just endorsement)
→ Clear business case with measurable outcomes
→ Data infrastructure before model development
→ Integration architecture designed first
→ Human oversight built in
→ Compliance from day one

The hard truth: Most AI failures aren't technical failures. They're organizational failures.

The technology works. The implementation doesn't.
