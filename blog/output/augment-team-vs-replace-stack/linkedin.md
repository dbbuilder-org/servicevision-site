System slow. Deployments painful. Features take forever.

The debate begins:
"We need a modern stack!"
"We need better developers!"

Both can be right. Both can be expensive mistakes.

The wrong diagnosis:

→ Replace stack when problem is skills: New stack, same problems
→ Add people when problem is tech: More people fighting bad tools

**Signs the STACK is the problem:**

• Vendor/community abandoned it
• Security vulnerabilities without fixes
• Hard scaling limits you've hit
• Integration barriers that can't be worked around
• Nobody knows this technology anymore

**Signs the TEAM is the problem:**

• Other companies succeed with same stack
• Same bugs keep recurring
• Code quality declining over time
• Team clearly overextended
• No one owns technical direction

**How to diagnose correctly:**

1. Gather evidence - Don't rely on opinions
2. Get external perspective - Internal teams have biases
3. Root cause analysis - Trace problems to sources
4. Map solutions - Each cause → specific solution

**Augmentation options:**

→ Training: 3-6 months to results
→ Strategic hires: 6-12 months to impact
→ Fractional experts: Immediate expertise
→ Team extension: 2-4 weeks capacity

**Stack options:**

→ Incremental upgrade: 3-12 months
→ Strangler fig migration: 12-24 months
→ Full rebuild: 12-36 months (high risk)

**Often the answer is both—but sequence matters:**

Add technical leadership first.
Diagnose properly with fresh perspective.
Execute stack changes with strengthened team.

The worst outcome is guessing wrong.

Take time to diagnose before committing.
