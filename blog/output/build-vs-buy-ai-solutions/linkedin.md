Build or buy your AI solution?

The wrong choice can cost millions and years.

Here's a framework that actually works:

**The Decision Matrix:**

High differentiation + High strategic value = **Build Custom**
This is your competitive advantage. Worth the investment.

High differentiation + Low strategic value = **Build or Partner**
Unique needs but not core. Consider partnerships.

Low differentiation + High strategic value = **Buy and Customize**
Important but not unique. Buy proven, customize.

Low differentiation + Low strategic value = **Buy Off-the-Shelf**
Commodity. Buy cheapest that works.

**Seven factors to evaluate:**

1. **Differentiation** - Will this AI differentiate you from competitors?
2. **Strategic importance** - How central to your business?
3. **Data sensitivity** - PHI, PII, trade secrets involved?
4. **Customization needs** - How much will you need to customize?
5. **Timeline** - How fast do you need it?
6. **Internal capability** - Do you have the skills?
7. **Total cost** - What's the true 5-year cost?

**Often overlooked costs:**

Build: Ongoing maintenance (20-30% annually), retraining, staff turnover

Buy: Integration, customization, subscription increases

**The hybrid reality:**

Most companies end up with a mix—some built, some bought, some hybrid.

The key is making the right choice for each capability.
