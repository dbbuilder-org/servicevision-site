Your AI is deployed. It works. Stakeholders are happy.

Six months later: production issues, degraded accuracy, data scientists spending 80% of time on maintenance.

Welcome to AI technical debt.

It compounds faster than any debt in traditional software.

**Five types of AI debt:**

1. **Data Debt** - Quality degrades, schemas drift, lineage unknown
2. **Model Debt** - No retraining, no drift detection, algorithms stale
3. **Pipeline Debt** - Brittle processes, manual steps, no tests
4. **Infrastructure Debt** - Scaling issues, cost overruns, security gaps
5. **Documentation Debt** - Tribal knowledge, untracked experiments, no runbooks

The problem: These compound each other.

Data issues → model degradation → pipeline strain → infrastructure problems → more data issues.

**Warning signs:**

• Model freshness > 90 days: Critical
• Data quality < 85%: Critical
• Pipeline success < 95%: Critical
• MTTR > 4 hours: Critical
• Documentation < 50%: Critical

**Four strategies that work:**

→ The 20% Rule: Dedicate 20% of capacity to debt reduction. Every sprint.

→ Debt Sprints: Full sprints focused on debt, especially post-release.

→ Automated Prevention: Pre-commit hooks, CI/CD gates, drift detection.

→ Systematic Documentation: Model cards, experiment tracking, runbooks as first-class deliverables.

**The ROI:**

Without debt reduction: 70% time on maintenance
With debt reduction: 40% time on maintenance

The companies succeeding with AI aren't building the most models.

They're maintaining healthy systems over time.
